A list of TODOs for Privilege
============================================

- Write up a proper explanation on the idea on how Privilege, PrivilegePolicy,
  Restrictable and Roles fit together to grant privileges to Users

- Re-think the PrivilegePolicy and its 
  actionAllowed(Role, Privilege, Restrictable)-method. Maybe the Privilege
  argument is not needed, as this should be on the Role anyhow...

- Finish the JavaDoc

- Set up a website =)
