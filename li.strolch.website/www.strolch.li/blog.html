                <p class="blog-post-meta">July 8, 2015 by <a href="#">Robert</a></p>

                <p>The ground work of the Strolch planning engine has been laid.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>One of the core ideas in building Strolch was to create a planning engine. The planning engine would
                    work in combination of <code>Order</code> objects representing customer orders,
                    <code>Resource</code> objects representing machines, human resources, etc., and
                    <code>Activity</code>/<code>Action</code> hierarchies defining a workflow.</p>

                <p>With the latest couple of commits to Strolch we have now added <code>Activities</code> and a basic
                    planning of <code>Actions</code> onto <code>Resources</code>. <code>Activities</code> have an
                    ordered list of <code>IActivityElement</code> which allows creating an arbitrary deep tree structure
                    of <code>Activity</code> and <code>Action</code> elements.</p>

                <p><code>Action</code> objects have a list of <code>IValueChange</code> objects which define the start,
                    end and further value changes over time on a referenced <code>Resource</code>. Thus planning an
                    <code>Activity</code> is done by iterating the <code>Activity</code> hierarchy and for every <code>Action</code>
                    selecting a relevant <code>Resource</code> and then then applying the changes of the
                    <code>Action</code> on to the referenced <code>TimeState</code> on the <code>Resource</code>.</p>

                <p>This implementation is currently very simple as it ignores all constraints which a
                    <code>Resource</code> might have. In further development we shall implement a <code>Violation</code>
                    model so that UIs can be built to visualize the over-use of <code>Resources</code>.</p>

                <p>In even further steps we would then start implementing algorithms to not just apply the changes onto
                    a <code>Resource</code>, but to actually search the <code>Resource</code> for time slots when the
                    value changes would not violate any constraints applied to the resource.</p>

                <p>We are very much looking forward to these new features. Stay tuned for your updates - even though
                    they do take their time to arrive =).</p>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">April 6, 2015 by <a href="#">Robert</a></p>

                <p>Any good software has some decent documentation explaining concepts, best practices and gives
                    examples.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>So this post is to announce that there is now a new page on Strolch's website with a bit of
                    documentation. This first documentation explains the Strolch runtime and some of the do and don't in
                    Strolch code.</p>

                <p>Bear with us, writing documentation takes time and can be outdated quickly, so we will make an effort
                    to keep everything up to date and add more documentation, but this is a start.</p>

                <p>So go ahead and read the <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a> , and if you haven't already,
                    also read the rest of the website which should give some more insight into the <a href="index.html">what</a>,
                    <a href="index.html">why</a> and <a href="api.html">how</a> of Strolch.</p>

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">Strolch Release 1.0.0</h2>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">March 31, 2015 by <a href="#">Robert</a></p>

                <p>Finally Version 1.0.0 of Strolch has been released and can be <a href="downloads.html">downloaded</a>
                    immediately.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Before 1.0.0 could be released, some major changes were decided, all driven by the first big project
                    using Strolch as its underlying stack. Those changes were minor, and really major, but should make
                    Strolch better and was important for the first release.</p>

                <p>Here is a list of the most interesting changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Java 8 - Strolch was ported to Java 8. This gives a lot of cool features: The stream API,
                        lambdas, the new time API, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>TX refactoring: Strolch transactions are instances of <code>Closeable</code> so that they are
                        closed using a try-with-resource block in Java7. The change that was required was to not auto
                        commit. Now a TX is read-only and one has to set the auto commit as the last statement. See <a
                                href="https://github.com/eitchnet/strolch/commit/46ccb921dfa94f140cbaa3f459c2e434c913d720">this</a>
                        commit for more information.
                    </li>
                    <li>Added a <code>tx.flush()</code> to allow an implementation to flush part of a transaction, this
                        feature is vital to perform parts of a transaction before deciding if the TX should be
                        committed.
                    </li>
                    <li>Fixed the issue where data store mode <code>CACHED</code> performed <code>TRANSACTIONAL</code>
                        queries, instead of staying in-memory.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>ParameterSelection.stringListSelection()</code> uses a <code>StringMatchMode</code>
                        instead of just <code>equals()</code></li>
                    <li><code>ParameterSelection.dateRangeSelection()</code> uses a <code>DateRange</code> instead of
                        just <code>equals()</code></li>
                    <li>Added the <code>MigrationsHandler</code> to use to perform code migrations of production data
                        bases where data shouldn't go lost.
                    </li>
                    <li>And many more...</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Strolch 1.1.0 is already in development and can also be downloaded from the download page Here you
                    can see the current change list on <a
                            href="https://github.com/eitchnet/strolch/compare/1.0.0...develop">GitHub</a>. For instance
                    heavy work has been done to implement privilege management by adding a REST API. Looking forward to
                    a wonderful next Strolch release.</p>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">October 9, 2014 by <a href="#">Robert</a></p>

                <p>New <code>DurationParameter</code> and additional minor changes: Release of 1.0.0-RC4 which can be
                    downloaded on the <a href="downloads.html">download</a> page.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>While implementing a use case in a Strolch based application it was detected that an essential
                    parameter type was missing, the <code>DurationParameter</code>. This parameter currently stores the
                    value as a long in memory and serializes to <a
                            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations">ISO8601</a>. As soon as we move
                    Strolch to Java8, we will change this to use the <code>Period</code> class in the new Java8 date and
                    time API.</p>

                <p>In addition to the new parameter, a couple of other changes were made:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>32c1785 [Major] Added Session timeout handling</li>
                    <li>d55371e [Minor] fixed component version descriptions</li>
                    <li>c1cdfbb [Bugfix] added missing cloning of StringSetTimedState in Resources</li>
                    <li>8f50a15 [Major] changed XML format of time value of TimedStates to be ISO8601</li>
                    <li>5fbbe50 [Bugfix] fix NPE when cloning Resources with no state vars</li>
                    <li>b77f4b2 [New] added TimeVariable.clear()-method</li>
                    <li>Updated sub-module ch.eitchnet.utils to 906d24d</li>
                    <li>Updated sub-module ch.eitchnet.privilege to aa16887</li>
                </ul>

                <p>So, Strolch 1.0.0-RC4 is out the door, go ahead and <a href="downloads.html">try it out</a>.</p>

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">DB Initialization: Release 1.0.0-RC3</h2>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">August 24, 2014 by <a href="#">Robert</a></p>

                <p>Important feature <i>Database Initialization</i> added: Release of 1.0.0-RC3 which can be downloaded
                    on the <a href="downloads.html">download</a> page.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>When living <i>continuous integration</i> and <i>continuous delivery</i>, it is vital that things
                    like database migrations and initialization are performed in a controlled, but automatic way.</p>

                <p>A Strolch-based application is using the PostgreSQL persistence layer. The implementation understands
                    the concepts of migration, and validating the database schema, but currently a mechanism to
                    automatically initialize the database with a minimal set of data was missing.</p>

                <p>Migrating a database for Strolch is mostly a one time thing. The object model in Strolch is quite
                    static, so there is seldom a need to migrate the database. Domain specific changes, i.e. new
                    Resources, or adding Parameters to Resources, is not a schema change. Thus, instead of going the way
                    other frameworks go, e.g. Ruby on Rails, we built the data initialization right into the <code>PersistenceHandler</code>.
                </p>

                <p>Now if the PostgreSQL <code>PersistenceHandler</code> creates the schema, then it might also
                    initialize the minimal set of data. For this to work, the <code>PersistenceHandler</code> checks if
                    the flags <code>allowSchemaCreation</code>, <code>allowSchemaDrop</code> and <code>allowDbInitOnSchemaCreate</code>.
                    If those flags are enabled, and the schema was created during initialization, then the database is
                    also initialized with the contents of the XML file configured under key <code>dataStoreFile</code>
                    of the relevant <code>Realm</code>.</p>

                <p>The database initialization is done as a system user action which must have the name <code>db_initializer</code>.
                    This is another fail-safe, so that on a production system, this user can simply be deleted.</p>

                <p>So, Strolch 1.0.0-RC3 is out the door, go ahead and <a href="downloads.html">try it out</a>.</p>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">August 20, 2014 by <a href="#">Robert</a></p>

                <p>With the Go-Live of a Strolch-based application around the corner, it is time to release Version
                    1.0.0 of Strolch. To this affect we have now released version 1.0.0-RC1 which can be downloaded on
                    the <a href="downloads.html">download</a> page.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Story</h3>

                <p>Strolch as a component based software agent has been two years in the making. The concepts in Strolch
                    have been taken from a proprietary planning, scheduling and controlling software agent, which was,
                    and is been, used in industrial automation, logistics and production. Strolch was created to bring
                    the concepts, which were working well for small teams to go-live with large projects in short to
                    medium time-frames to the open source world.</p>

                <p>Strolch was completely rewritten using the key concepts of a parameterized object model and a
                    component based agent but remembering which clutches the original implementation had, thus trying to
                    eradicate those without bringing in new ones. It might not be perfect in version 1.0.0, but it is a
                    starting point form which to carry on from.</p>

                <h3>Features</h3>

                <p>Strolch isn't feature complete by a long shot, but it sure has got many features which make it
                    useable in a concrete project, thus making sure it is not vaporware =)</p>

                <p>The following is a list of key features, many of which were driven by concrete project
                    requirements:</p>

                            href="https://github.com/eitchnet/ch.eitchnet.utils/tree/master/src/main/java/ch/eitchnet/communication">communicate</a>
                        with external devices using TCP/IP
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>With the light weight implementation, where there are basically no third party libraries required for
                    the normal runtime, Strolch has a minimal foot print which allows it to run on small devices for
                    instance a <a href="http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone+Black">BeagleBone Black</a>. Using
                    the in-memory mode, it is an easy feat to set up test environments with little to no further
                    requirements than the JVM.</p>

                <h3>Future</h3>

                <p>So what is planned for the future? Although Strolch has quite a few interesting features, it is by no
                    way feature complete. The greatest wish is for Strolch to become a community driven platform, so
                    many new features will arise in the future, but at least one major future feature which will be
                    tackled in the near future and will certainly drive the next major release is a planning and
                    scheduling engine using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart">Gantt</a> chart to
                    visualize the schedule.</p>

                <p>The planning engine will use the timed values on Resources extensively to create a planning engine on
                    which Workflows can be placed and allowing to detect violations and bottlenecks.</p>

                <p>An extension of the planning of the scheduling engine will allow more than just placing Workflows on
                    Resources, but actually searching groups of Resources for a time slot of when to place tasks. This
                    will allow to use capacity constraints to plan and schedule workflows using different algorithms,
                    and respecting calendars etc.</p>

                <p>Further time will be spent on giving Strolch it's own UI. Currently the idea is to use <a
                        href="http://www.polymer-project.org/">Google's Polymer</a> to implement the UI, thus creating
                    reusable widgets that can be used in projects.</p>

                <h3>Take it for a spin</h3>

                <p>So, now the important part is for new users to start using Strolch for their own projects. Go ahead,
                    check out the <a href="downloads.html">Downloads</a> page for the latest release and then checkout
                    the two tutorial applications to get yourself up to speed!</p>

                <p>Don't hesitate to send us feedback or questions, we will be delighted to help you get your
                    Strolch-based application up and running, or provide feedback to your concerns!</p>

                <p>Strolch is an open source component based software agent written in Java and can be compared, in a
                    light sense, with the Java EE stack: Strolch takes care of persistence, implements Services for use
                    cases, Commands as re-usable algorithms and has a parameterized data model.</p>
